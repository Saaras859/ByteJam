    "# Blackjack Game Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Players**: 2 (Computer vs Human)\n",
    "- **Objective**: Reach a card sum closest to 21 without exceeding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Card Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number Cards**: Face value (2-10)\n",
    "- **Face Cards** (Jack, Queen, King): 10\n",
    "- **Ace**: 1 or 11 (player's choice)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Deal**: Each player receives two random cards. Card values range from 1 to 11.\n",
    "2. **Player's Turn**:\n",
    "   - **Draw Option**: Player can draw additional cards to get closer to 21.\n",
    "   - **Stand Option**: Player can choose to stop drawing cards.\n",
    "   - **Bust**: If total sum exceeds 21, the player automatically loses.\n",
    "3. **Dealer's (Computer's) Turn**:\n",
    "   - **Mandatory Draw**: Dealer must draw cards until the total is 17 or more.\n",
    "   - **Stand**: Dealer stands if the sum is 17 or more.\n",
    "   - **Bust**: If dealer's total exceeds 21, the dealer automatically loses.\n",
    "4. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - **Player Wins**: If player's total is greater than the dealer's and ≤ 21.\n",
    "   - **Dealer Wins**: If dealer's total is greater than the player's and ≤ 21.\n",
    "   - **Bust Rule**: Player or dealer automatically loses if their total exceeds 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure a fair random function for card drawing.\n",
    "- Implement UI with two buttons: \"Draw\" for drawing cards, \"Stand\" to end turn.\n",
    "- The game continues until either player stands or busts.\n",
    "- The winner is determined by comparing the totals of the player and the dealer.\n"

The **create_deck** function generates and shuffles a deck using list comprehensions and the random.shuffle function from the random module. Additionally, the **card_value** function determines the numerical value of a card based on its rank, with special consideration for face cards and the flexible value of an Ace. These functions lay the foundation for a card game, offering a shuffled deck and a mechanism to assign values to cards for gameplay purposes."
