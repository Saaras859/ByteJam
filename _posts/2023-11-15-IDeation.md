## How the game works:

Two players: one Computer and one human player Objective of the game is to get the sum of cards closest to 21 Jack, King, Queen all equal to 10, Ace can equal 11 or 1 Players can decide when they want to stop drawing cards. As soon as the sum of cards is above 21, the player loses.

### Game Rules in depth:

- Use the random function to start by giving a player two values, where the values are between 1 and 11.
- Allow the user to keep on drawing values (random function). Then, have two buttons: a stand (done) button and a keep drawing (draw) button.
- If player totalsum > 21, the player automatically loses.
- If the dealer (computer) has a value under 17, he HAS to draw another card. If the sum of cards is equal to 17 or greater, the dealer has to stand.
- In the end, compare values of player to dealer. If player > dealer, player wins; if player is less than dealer, player loses. If player is greater than 21, the player auto loses. If the dealer is over 21, the dealer auto loses.

### Ideation/Plans:

```javascript
// 1. Card Representation:
// Represent each card in binary to save space and simplify comparisons.
// For each card, use a 4-bit binary to represent the rank and another 2 bits for the suit.

// 2. Initialize Deck:
function initializeDeck() {
    // Create a function to initialize the deck using binary representations for each card.
}

// 3. Deal Cards:
function dealInitialCards(deck) {
    // Implement a function to deal two initial cards to both the player and the dealer.
}

// 4. Player Actions:
function playerDraw(deck) {
    // Allow the player to draw cards until they decide to stand or the total exceeds 21.
}

// 5. Dealer Actions:
function dealerDraw(deck) {
    // Implement the dealer's logic to draw cards until their total is 17 or more.
}

// 6. Calculate Hand Value:
function calculateHandValue(hand) {
    // Create a function to calculate the total value of a hand, considering the special case of Ace.
}

// 7. Compare Results:
function compareHands(playerHand, dealerHand) {
    // After both the player and the dealer stand, compare their hands to determine the winner.
}

// 8. Binary Conversion:
function binaryToHuman(card) {
    // Utilize binary conversions to represent and compare card values efficiently.
}

function binaryToSuit(binary) {
    // Convert binary suit representation to human-readable format.
}

function binaryToRank(binary) {
    // Convert binary rank representation to human-readable format.
}
